Database implementation:
PyCharm SQLAlchemy v1.3.13 package was used

Database testing:
The script works by uncommenting certain parts of the code (pandaDb.*).
How to use:
1.	Uncomment phase 1. Database is created. Recomment.
2.	Use pwp_DB_testData to populate the DB. We used DBBrowser to copypaste.
3.	Uncomment phase 2. If 1 was succesful, database is printed. Recomment.
4.	Uncomment phase 3. Tests instance retrieval. Recomment.
5.	Uncomment phase 4. Tests instance creation. Recomment.
6.	Uncomment phase 5. Tests instance update. Recomment.
7.	Uncomment phase 6. Tests instance deletion. Recomment.
8.	Tests done, congratulations.
